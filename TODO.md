# TODO

SAV:
- String manangement (pool/bucket array)
- SAV managing its own memory for rendering (collect data in ram before subbing to gpu ram) + simplifying passing vertex data from user code
- Better string drawing/extending into a GUI library
- My own printf/format string extensions. E.g. for v2, etc.
